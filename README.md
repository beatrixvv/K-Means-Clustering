This interactive system allows users to view data with K-Means clustering and correct the data by moving the points on the chart.

To run the program:
1. Open the index.html

To interact with the control panel:
1. Hover the mouse on the box to edit the number of clusters and use the arrow to increase or decrease the number of clusters (the minimum number is 2, and the maximum is 10)
2. Use the slider to increase or decrease the radius (the minimum radius is 1, and the maximum is 20)
3. Select the dataset by selecting a choice from the dropdown menu
3. Select the distance function by selecting a choice from the dropdown menu

To move the data:
1. Click on the desired point to select it. Users can select up to 5 points
2. Drag in the blank space to move the selected point(s)
3. To deselect all selections, press "x" on the keyboard

Notes:
* The slider's style can only be seen correctly using the Firefox browser (the slider can function properly in different browsers, but it may have a different style)
* When you select more than one data, all selected data will be moved
* Mouse events can only be listened in the canvas area
